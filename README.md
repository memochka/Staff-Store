# Staff-Store

Develop an ASP.NET MVC 5 Web application in Visual Studio 2017 using the Ninject, Moq, and Entity Framework 6 tools. The main reason for adopting the MVC Framework is testing support.

The Staff Store app follows the classic approach used by online stores around the world.

Was created:
1.	Online catalog of products that customers can browse by categories and pages;
2.	A shopping cart where users can add and remove products;
3.	Check where customers can enter delivery information;
4.	Contacts, About us, Payment and delivery.

An administrative area has also been created that includes creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) for directory management, and is protected so that only registered administrators can make changes.

This web application uses unit testing, because it is an important part of the development process.
